CLASS OVERVIEW.
Defining a Class
A class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class. The body of the class contains the constructor and methods.

Notes:
The constructor is a special method used to initialize object properties.
Methods defined inside a class do not require the function keyword.
The new keyword is used to create instances of the class.
